Crossgoat is Livejournal crossposting tool that acts as LJ posting API proxy. It
allows you to automatically cross-post your blog posts to multiple servers based
on Livejournal code (for example, livejournal.com and lj.rossia.org).

Crossgoat acts as a proxy for LJ posting protocol (only 'plain' is supported
right now, xmlrpc not supported). You configure client to post to crossgoat cgi
script and post is cross-posted to LJ servers set in config.

== Install ==

To install, you need a webserver with CGI support and Python installed in system
(tested with Python 2.5, I don't know if it will work on other versions).

There is example .htaccess for Apache httpd.

After installing CGI executable, copy/rename crossgoat.ini.example to
crossgoat.ini and edit it. You can add multiple users and more than two posting
destinations for each user.
